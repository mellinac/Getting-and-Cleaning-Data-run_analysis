This code book describes the columns in the file titled, "meanColumnsGroupedByActivityAndVolunteer.txt"

"activity": The activity codes 1 through 6 represent the actions the voluneets took to collect data.  
          The activites are: 1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING

"volunteer": There were 30 volunteers that made up this data set.  Each volunteer was assigned a number, 1-30.

The following 65 column names in the file were summarized using the mean function for each volunteer and activity.  Measurements were taken in either time or frequency.  Most measurements were recorded in the x, y, and z directions.  The measurements in the file are the value of the mean or standard deviation.  The names of the comlumns were renamed from the original data frame to be more descriptive.
